# UART NFC Logger
UART NFC Logger is an Android app that reads data from an UART-connected NFC chip and logs card ID data. The app runs as a foreground service, ensuring continuous operation even when minimized.

## Features
* NFC Data Logging: Reads and logs card ID data from an NFC chip connected via UART
* Broadcast intent: All logs generated by the app will be broadcasted with an intent, making it possible to integrate with automation tools and third-party applications such as Tasker
* Foreground Service: Ensures continuous background operation
* DKCloudID Integration: Utilizes DKCloudID for NFC operations

## Supported modules
